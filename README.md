# md380tools-gui
Windows GUI for md380tools project

The Windows installation of md380tools is more complex than for linux so this GUI aims to simplify the installation and usage of md380tools and it's required packages. In the short term, it will function to generate and flash the experimental firmware images.

The longer term goal is to add functionality to use the original STM DFU Driver in order to write the user database to the radios SPI Flash as this feature currently doesn't work with Windows for some unknown reason.
